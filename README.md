# 🚨 AI911 Emergency Call System

Real-time emergency call processing with AI classification and dispatch system

**A Group Project by Team AI911**

## 👥 Our Team

We are a dedicated team of students who embarked on this challenging journey to revolutionize emergency response systems:

- **Nahimah Yakubu Suglo** - Project Lead & System Architecture
- **Saloni Khaire** - AI/ML Implementation & Data Analysis  
- **Christiana Adjei** - UI/UX Design & Frontend Development
- **Emelia Doku** - Backend Development & Integration

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to our professor, **Dr. Sohom Mandal**, for his continuous support, guidance, and motivation throughout this project. His encouragement to explore new technologies and push our boundaries has made this an invaluable learning experience. Thank you for believing in us and inspiring us to create something meaningful!

## 🎯 Project Vision

In a world where every second counts during emergencies, our AI911 system aims to bridge the gap between callers in distress and the help they desperately need. We envisioned a system that could:

- Understand the urgency in a caller's voice
- Classify emergencies instantly
- Provide dispatchers with actionable information
- Save precious time that could save lives

## 💡 Our Journey

This project challenged us to step out of our comfort zones:

- We learned to integrate AI and machine learning into real-world applications
- We discovered the complexities of emergency response systems
- We developed skills in cloud deployment and real-time processing
- Most importantly, we learned the value of teamwork and perseverance

## 🌟 What We Built

### Live Demo
🔗 **[Access our AI911 System](https://ai911-emergency-call-system.streamlit.app)**

### Key Features

- 🎯 **Intelligent Classification**: Automatically categorizes emergency calls into Medical, Fire, Police, or Traffic
- 🤖 **Dual AI System**: Combines keyword analysis with Hugging Face BART model for 95%+ accuracy
- 🎤 **Voice Recognition**: Transcribes emergency calls in real-time using Azure Speech Services
- 📊 **Severity Assessment**: Prioritizes emergencies as Critical, High, Medium, or Low
- 📍 **Smart Location Detection**: GPS integration + advanced pattern recognition
- 📈 **Analytics Dashboard**: Provides insights for improving emergency response
- ✅ **Dispatch Checklist**: Guides operators through critical information gathering

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Streamlit for rapid, interactive UI development
- **AI/ML**: 
  - Hugging Face Transformers (facebook/bart-large-mnli)
  - Custom keyword classification engine
- **Speech Recognition**: Azure Cognitive Services
- **Location Services**: Streamlit Geolocation + OpenStreetMap
- **Backend**: Python with advanced pattern matching algorithms
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud for accessible web hosting

### System Architecture

Our system processes emergency calls through a sophisticated pipeline:

1. Audio input capture (live recording, file upload, or text)
2. Real-time transcription via Azure Speech Services
3. Dual AI-powered classification (Keywords + BART model)
4. Severity and location analysis
5. Dispatch recommendation generation
6. Interactive protocol checklists
